IYTE EE142 GRAY CODE GENERATION

Gray code, also known as reflected binary code, is a binary numeral system where two consecutive numbers differ by only one bit. In other words, it is a way to represent numbers in binary form such that only one bit changes between consecutive numbers.

This code generates gray codes from 3-bit to 10-bit and prints out time elapsed during execution times in a text file.
